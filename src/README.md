# Overview

- This is a project is a demonstration of the syntax I learned about Java as a beginner in Java.  This project was also to help add to my utility belt of coding languages and practice working with data structures.  What is featured in this project is variable declaration/manipulation, method reaction, class creations, class expansion, class manipulation, iteration, loops, and recursion.

## Description
- This program is a logical representation of the board game "Sorry!" coded in Java.  4 players (1 user & 3 CPUs) take turns rolling a dice (numbered 0 to 12) to move their pawns to home.  The first player to have all pawns reach home (a target number) then that player wins.


## Purpose 
* This is a project is a demonstration of the syntax I learned about Java as a beginner in Java.  This project was also to help add to my utility belt of coding languages and practice working with data structures.

# Future Work
- Something to fix: I would do some refactoring since there is some code that repeats.
- Something to improve: I would improve the game with adding specific effects for certain numbers.
- Something to add: I would add a set of cards so that it limits the future players and involves more chance and strategy.  Additionally, I would add logic to mathmatically represent the curvature of an actual Sorry! game board.
